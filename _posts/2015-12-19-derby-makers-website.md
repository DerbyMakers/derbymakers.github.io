This is a new website we are beginning to develop.  There's not much here yet but we hope to have some real content uploaded soon.

The website is made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DerbyMakers/derbymakers.github.io).  During this early stage of setup, the sample posts from Jekyll and the [current theme (Lanyon)](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) have been left on the website so people new to them have some example posts to browse.
